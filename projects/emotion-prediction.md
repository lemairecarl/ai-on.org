## Problem description:

AIs lack "moral common sense". As morals and emotions are tightly linked, having an AI that predicts the emotional consequences of an event would be a valuable step towards integrating morals in learning systems.

## Why this problem matters:

We have seen multiple instances of deep learning systems showing "insensitive" or "immoral" behaviour. Morals are part of our cultural baggage; there is no reason to expect a morally acceptable behaviour from a machine. Morals can be viewed as a way to quickly and instinctively assess the acceptability of an action, without analysing its potentially very complex long-term consequences. Emotions can be seen as a way to have a sense of the implications of an event.

Consider these two sentences:
* "I just ate some pie."
* "I just lost my mother."

We have a much stronger response to the second sentence, but an algorithmic language model just considers both as valid sentences. From the second sentence, a human can predict that the person is sad, and that talking about her mother should likely be avoided.

## How to measure success:

Given a simple context (e.g. a few pages of a children's book) with the emotional vocabulary words removed, the system should be able to predict those missing words.

## Datasets:

I haven't found what would be the right dataset for the task. I still need to look in the Question Answering and Reading Comprehension literature.

## Relevant Work:

We should look at the Question Answering and Reading Comprehension literature.
